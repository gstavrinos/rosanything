# ROSANYTHING!
---
Create custom commands that use autocmplete of ROS messages with ease!

:warning:

The `install\_rosanything` python script messes with your `.bashrc` file. Please use it at your own risk.

Currently, the removal of a custom command can be done only manually by deleting the shell script created inside the `bash` folder and removing the source command that was appended in `.bashrc`.
